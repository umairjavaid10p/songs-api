## `koa2-kickstarter`
> An opinionated boilerplate for koa v2 with batteries included.

### Setup
```bash
  # clone the repository
  λ git clone https://github.com/umayr/koa2-kickstarter
  # change the current directory
  λ cd koa2-kickstarter
  # install all dependencies
  λ npm install
  # run the project
  λ npm start
```
or execute the script
```
  λ curl -sSL https://git.io/v5yGw | bash
  # with a project name
  λ curl -sSL https://git.io/v5yGw | bash -s new-app
```

### Structure
```bash
├── README.md           # you're here
├── bin                 # folder that bootstraps the application
├── src                 # contains source files
│   ├── config            # wraps configurations files
│   ├── controller      # contains all controllers in the application
│   ├── middleware      # folder with all middlewares
│   ├── route           # wraps all the routes and exports a single composed middleware
│   └── service         # contains all the service logic
└── test                # unit tests
```

**Suggestion:** Every folder name is _singular_ like `route`, `middleware` instead of `routes`, `middlewares`. If you want to add more folders as per your need, make sure they should be singular too (for e.g. `util`, `helper` etc) only for the sake of consistency.
